Hi, welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy and Government at Fundação Getulio Vargas (EAESP/FGV). 

Currently, I am working on two impact evaluation projects that illustrate how educational and health technologies can improve human capital accumulation among highschool and primary students in Brazilian public schools.

More generally, I am interested in empirical and econometric work in development economics, and dedicate my time to policy work. I truly believe that evidence-informed decision-making is the key to the development and strengthening of public policies and to positively impact the livelihoods of those who need the most.

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Social Sciences and a bachelor’s and Msc. degree in Economics from the São Paulo School of Economics (EESP/FGV).  In the past, I worked in the World Bank at Washington DC supporting countries in the Latin America and Caribbean Region and countries in the South Asia Region.
