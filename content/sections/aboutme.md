Hi, welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy and Government at Fundação Getulio Vargas (EAESP/FGV). 

Currently, I am working on two impact evaluation projects that illustrate how educational and health technologies can improve human capital accumulation among highschool and primary students in Brazilian public schools.

I hold a bachelor’s and Msc. degree in Economics from the São Paulo School of Economics (EESP/FGV) and a bachelor's.  In the past, I worked in the World Bank at Washington DC supporting countries in the Middle East.
